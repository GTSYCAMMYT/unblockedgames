PLEASE READ THE RULES THAT FOLLOW.

1. Do NOT start a war.
2. If your request gets delayed, please don't keep begging me to do it now. If you beg me when delayed all of your requests will never be done.
3. Mods, if you argue with trolls please try to block them and move on. I'll take care of them later. If you keep it up, however, I'll take away your mod permission.
4. Do not request anything that has nothing to do with Disney. Reason: When I try to upload Nick Jr. or PBS Kids stuff, it gets blocked.

That's about it, enjoy! =)
